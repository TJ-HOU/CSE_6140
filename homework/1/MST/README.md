To run:
From the main directory, run ``./runTests.sh'``.
This will go into /data/ and pull each graph and its addition edges then call run_experiments.py.
Outputs will be found in /results/.

To run an individual graph file, call python run_experiments.py <graphfile>.gr <graphfile>.extra <outputfile>.out
