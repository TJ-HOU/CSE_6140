Alexander Winkles:

Score - 10
Contributions
- Designed approximation algorithm
- Solved graphs with approximation algorithm
- Wrote all details related to approximation algorithm in report
- Wrote introduction and problem section in report
- Ran LS1 graphs and obtained their solutions
- Wrote README file
- Wrote runproject file

Overall I feel like I contributed a good amount both with my algorithm I was assigned as well as various parts of the report. 
In addition to writing the approximation algorithm and running it on all graph instances, I designed the runproject file that
is called to use any of the algorithms with any file. 
I additionally wrote the README file for our code that outlines how to run any graph.

Junlin Liu:

Score - 10
Contributions
- Designed bnb algorithm
- Solved graphs with bnb
- Did LaTeX formatting for report
- Ran LS2 graphs and obtained solutions
- Made graphs for LS2
- Wrote all parts in the report related to bnb, along with formatting
- Made LS1 tables

Junlin was an excellent teamate who always did his work on time. Additionally he was willing to help with various aspects of
the project and was always asking if he could help us. Because of this I believe he deserves a 10.

Contributions
- Designed LS1 algorithm
- Designed LS2 algorithm
- Made Github for project
- Made graphs for LS1
- Wrote all parts related to local search in report

Deepthi did a good job designing her algorithms and writing about them. Unfortunately she passed on a lot of the computation work
to Junlin and me because she had other projects to do. Additionally, she didn't do several parts of the report until an hour before
the report was due. Because of this, I believe she deserves an 8.
